# 3D rotation and Lie group

## Euler angles

Euler angles are a set of three angles introduced by Leonhard Euler that are used to describe the orientation or rotation of a rigid body in three-dimensional space.

: Often be called as Roll, rotation around the x axis.
: Often be called as Pitch, rotation around the y axis.
: Often be called as Yaw, rotation around the z axis.
