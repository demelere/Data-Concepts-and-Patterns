# Graph Optimization

## What is a graph?
A graph is a pair, where is a set of vertices, each of which contains some parameters to be optimized. is a set of connected information, whose elements are denotes the constraint relationship between two vertices.  Many robotics and computer vision problems can be represented by a graph problem.
